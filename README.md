Atary 2600 game in early alpha stage. 

It is about a car on a highway and you have to avoid collision the best you can. The button accelerates.

All the build tools used are in the directory tools with the respective documentation. I believe they are open source, if not, please contact me and I will remove it from the documentation.

Road map:

  -Random car position 
  
  -Score
  
  -Power ups
  
  -Multiplayer

The source code is in the file opb.asm, the game is the opb.bin, use your favorite Atari emulator to run it.

Fell free to contribute! It would make me very happy :)


A very special thanks to all the https://www.atariage.com/ community!
